description: "The Voyage of the Beagle is the title most commonly given to reissues\
  \ of the book written by Charles Darwin and published in 1839 as his Journal and\
  \ Remarks, bringing him considerable fame and respect. This was the third volume\
  \ of The Narrative of the Voyages of H.M. Ships Adventure and Beagle, and covers\
  \ Darwin's part in the second survey expedition of the ship HMS Beagle, which set\
  \ sail from Plymouth Sound on 27 December 1831 under the command of Captain Robert\
  \ FitzRoy, R.N.. Due to the popularity of Darwin's account, the publisher reissued\
  \ it later in 1839 as Darwin's Journal of Researches, and the revised second edition\
  \ published in 1845 used this title. A republication of the book in 1905 introduced\
  \ the title The Voyage of the \"Beagle\".\nWhile the expedition was originally planned\
  \ to last two years, it lasted almost fiveâ€”the Beagle did not return until 2 October\
  \ 1836. Darwin spent most of this time exploring on land (three years and three\
  \ months on land; 18 months at sea).\nThe book is a vivid and exciting travel memoir\
  \ as well as a detailed scientific field journal covering biology, geology, and\
  \ anthropology that demonstrates Darwin's keen powers of observation, written at\
  \ a time when Western Europeans were exploring and charting the whole world. Although\
  \ Darwin revisited some areas during the expedition, for clarity the chapters of\
  \ the book are ordered by reference to places and locations rather than by date.\
  \ Darwin's notes made during the voyage include comments illustrating his changing\
  \ views at a time when he was developing his theory of evolution by natural selection\
  \ and includes some suggestions of his ideas, particularly in the second edition\
  \ of 1845.\n\n\n From Wikipedia (CC BY-SA)."
